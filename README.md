# Rendez-Doc
this app is for doctors , it helps users to get to the nearest doctors in town

Project created for autolearning where I try to apply the new **Material Design** and Android good practices to develop a **Doctors Annuaire (Rendez-Docs)** application using a mocked list of **doctors list** as the domain of the application.
 
Motivation
----
After I was givin the idea of making this app by one of my freinds , I liked it and we decided to make it,
